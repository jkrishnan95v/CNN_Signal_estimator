# Source_detector

This project uses a CNN to perform Radio Signal source detection.  
A 20 element array is used to estimate the number of signals impinging it.   

Output of the code includes plots of the training and validation error, stats(precision,sensitivity, and specificity), a confusion matrix, and the ROC plot of the test data.

Work submitted for APS-URSI 2021 and for IEEE-TAP special issue on ML
