# CNN_Signal_estimator

This project uses a CNN to perform Radio Signal source detection.  
A 20 element array is used to estimate the number of signals impinging it.   

Output of the code includes plots of the training and validation error, stats(precision,sensitivity, and specificity), and a confusion matrix of the test data.
